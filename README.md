Note: we have provided details on our application in
the written submission component of this deliverable. 
(See the "About" section accessible from homepage.)

You will not need to run the scraper files for this deliverable.
We have disabled them. However, if you were to run
historical_scraper.py, it requires the selenium package to be installed. 
You would need to install it before running the script (should you 
require to run it). Also, all python scripts are written for 2.7, 
don't run it using python3 please.

Hello

Try our application out on the web here: https://valueinvestingtool.herokuapp.com/

Since we use heroku for deployment, and they use dynos, the first time the site is launched 
after a period of inactivity, it would take about 5-15 secs to render. This is a 
limitation of the free account of heroku. Subsequent reloads will be rendered at normal
speeds.
