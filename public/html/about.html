                        <p class="longText">
                            Suppose a stock costs $100 per share. How would you know this is a good price? Value investing looks at how much financial performance your $100 is buying you to determine if it is a good value. A simple example would help explain this. 
                            <br> <br>
                            Let's say you were going to buy 20 eggs for $2. This means every 10 cents buys you 1 egg. So it has a price-to-egg ratio of 10 cents. This is a better deal than 20 eggs for $4, which would have a price-to-egg ratio of 20 cents. The key factor is how many eggs your money is buying you. If the price of the eggs went up, but you didn't get any more eggs, then the deal got worse. Similarly, if the price went down, and you got the same amount of eggs, the deal got better.
                            <br> <br>
                            Just like we just looked at the price-to-eggs ratio, value investing looks at financial performance ratios to determine whether you are getting a good deal or not. Our tool provides near real time data on four of these financial performance ratios. We will describe these for you here:
                        </p>

                    <h2 class="sectionTitle2">P/E Ratio</h2>
                        <p class="longText">
                            The P/E Ratio is the price-to-earnings ratio. It is a very popular ratio to examine. The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the share price by how many dollar amount of earnings per share. For example, if a stock costs $100 and per share, and the company earns $5 per share, the P/E would be $100 / $5 = 20. Just like you wanted the price-to-eggs ratio to be low (i.e. 10 cents rather than 20 cents), you want the P/E ratio to be low. Many stocks have a P/E of around 15. Any P/E higher than 25 should be avoided unless it is a growth stock. It's useful to see how a company's P/E is doing currently, compared to how it normally does. Our color coding feature helps you see this (which we will show you in the next section).
                        </p>

                    <h2 class="sectionTitle2">P/S Ratio</h2>
                        <p class="longText">
                            The P/S Ratio is the price-to-sales ratio. The P/S ratio measures the price of a company's stock against its annual sales, instead of earnings. Like the P/E ratio, the P/S reflects how many times investors are paying for every dollar of a company's sales. For example, if a stock costs $100 per share, and has $50 in sales per share, the P/S ratio would be $100 / $50 = 2. Sometimes a company can be generating sales but not have any earnings because their expenses are very high and the expenses are erasing all their profits. Startup companies often don't have positive earnings, so it is good to look at the P/S ratio to track the company's progress. 
                        </p>

                    <h2 class="sectionTitle2">P/B Ratio</h2>
                        <p class="longText">
                            The P/B Ratio is the price-to-book ratio. Book refers to book value, which is the total value of all of the assets of the company. For example, suppose a company has issued a million shares to the public and each share costs $100. This makes the market capitalization of the company 1 million x $100 = $100 million. Further suppose that the book value of the company is $20 million. To calculate the price-to-book ratio, we divide the company's market capitalization by the book value. Therefore, in this example, the price-to-book ratio will be $100 million / $20 million = 5. 
                        </p>

                    <h2 class="sectionTitle2">DIV</h2>
                        <p class="longText">
                            Some companies pay you money four times a year for owning their shares. This payment is called a dividend. Growth companies often do not pay dividend, while long-established companies often do. A typical dividend is around 2.5%. For example, if the stock price costs $100, and you get paid $3 over the course of the year, the dividend is $3 / $100 = 3% (dividends are usually expressed in percentages). Unlike the other three ratios, you want a high dividend.

                            <div class="aboutContentDiv">Next, click on either "Search" section, or the link at the top right corner of the page. This will bring you to the search feature:</div>

                            <br><br>

                            <div class="aboutContentDiv">The search bar allows you to search by a company's name or its trading symbol. Let's try to find Boeing Airlines by typing "BA" into the search bar:</div>

                            <div class="aboutContentDiv">You will see that the financial performance ratios have colored circles associated with them. We will explain this in a few paragraphs. But for now, let's look at the rank. We calculate the rank by seeing how well the company's financial ratios are performing in relation to the other companies in our stock collection. If a company is performing in the best 10% for a particular ratio, it will receive a score for that ratio of 1. If it is in the bottom 10%, it will receive a score of 10. These scores are then summed, and like a golf score, you want the lowest sum. A rank of 1 is the best. Much financial research has shown that evaluating a company's performance as a collection of ratios rather than just one can be very helpful for selecting stocks in which to invest or not invest. Boeing has a rank of 20, which means it is doing well.</div>

                            <div class="aboutContentDiv">Now, as you enter more stocks, they will get added to your workspace. In this example, we added Agilent and Citigroup:</div>

                        </p>

                        <p class="longText">
                            Now we will describe the color coding scheme to you. If a ratio is currently a much better deal than normal, the circle will be colored bright green. If it is better than normal, dark green. If the ratio is currently at or near its average, it will be black. If the ratio is currently performing worse than usual, it will be colored dark red. And if it is currently performing much worse than usual, it will be colored bright red. You can see that most of the stocks we've chosen are either red or black. From a value investor's standpoint, these stocks look expensive. You are getting less financial performance per dollar spent than you typically do with these companies. 
                            
                            <br><br>
                            
                            You can adjust the breakpoints between the colors. For example, you might want black to be +/- 10% instead of +/- 25%. This is accomplished in the "Preferences" section, which we will explain next.

                            <br><br>

                            <div class="aboutContentDiv">You can drag the breakpoints on the slider to places you see fit. Remember: you want lower ratios.

The colors on the screen in your workbench will get updated in real time.</div>

Black is substituted for bright red (performing very poorly), dark gray for dark red (performing poorly), gray for black (performing at or close to normal), light gray for dark green (performing better than normal), and white for light green (performing much better than normal).</div>

                            <div class="aboutContentDiv">The market, at its broadest level, consists of sectors such as Consumer Staples and Financials. The next level of detail is industries such as Tobacco and Consumer Finance. At the most detailed level, we have individual companies such as American Express, Microsoft, and Coca Cola. The Explore feature allows you to wander through these different levels. You can see how entire sectors are doing, how industries are doing, and how individual companies are doing. Let's go through an Explore journey together.

                            Start by going to the homepage and then clicking on the Explore box or the explore link at the top of the page:</div>

These colors are calculated by taking the average performance of the underlying industries that make up each sector. Let's try clicking on Consumer Staples to see how that industry is doing:</div>
